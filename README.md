# Elephant_Detection_Using_OpenCV
Developed an elephant detection system using Python and OpenCV with contour-based object detection.  Applied preprocessing steps like grayscale conversion, Gaussian blur, and morphological operations to enhance image features.  Used thresholding and contour area filtering to identify and isolate elephant-like shapes in images.
